            <p>
                Transcripts will be evaluated to determine which credits will apply to the
                program of study you intend to pursue at Green River.  Credits earned at
                institutions accredited by their regional accrediting association may be
                accepted.  To find out if an educational institution is accredited by their
                regional accrediting association, you can use the accreditation database provided
                by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Postsecondary Education.
                On the website, you can search for an institution by its name and find its
                accrediting agency.

          <div>
            <p>
                Priority deadline March 15, 2015
                Financial Aid is available in three forms:
                <ul>
                    <li>Gift Aid  grants and scholarships</li>
                    <li>Employment Ð jobs on or off campus</li>
                    <li>Loans Ð low interest with deferred repayment</li>
                Financial aid awards are processed throughout the year in the order that
                files are completed, so it is best to apply as early as possible to receive
                the funding that is still available. Late applications are less likely
                to have their award notices completed prior to the start of the quarter.
